Position Sticky 的原理

HomePod 主要就是利用的 Sticky 原理

速写法：

```
.part-$*4
<-->
<div class="part-1"></div>
<div class="part-2"><div>
<div class="part-3"><div>
<div class="part-4"></div>
```

position: sticky

```
随着页面的滚动，当方块(含有sticky)上边缘0距离，粘在了上边缘
注意： position:sticky的元素是在父容器仍然在画面中的时候生效。 当父容器完结时，position: sticky 就会结束
```
